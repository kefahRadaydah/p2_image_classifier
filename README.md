# 🖼️ P2: Image Classifier

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project is part of the Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree by Udacity. It focuses on building an image classification model using deep learning techniques to identify different types of flowers from images. The model is trained using transfer learning and later converted into a command-line application for practical use.

## 🎯 Objective
- Train a deep neural network to classify flower images into 102 categories.
- Apply transfer learning using a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet or VGG).
- Convert the notebook-based model into a Python script for command-line inference.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Command-line scripting with argparse

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary
- Data Preparation
- Load flower image dataset with 102 categories.
- Model Training
- Use transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN.
- Fine-tune the model on the flower dataset.
- Model Saving
- Save the trained model in .h5 format.
- Command-line Interface
- Implement predict.py to classify new images using the saved model.
  
## 📈 Key Results
The trained model successfully classifies flower images with high accuracy. It demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in reducing training time and improving performance on limited data.
